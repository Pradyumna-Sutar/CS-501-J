Trace the Bubble SortProvided the unsorted array ` [7, 4, 2, 9, 1] ` and trace the bubble sort algorithmstep by step, showing the changes in the array after each pass.

Initial array: [9, 3, 5, 2, 6, 1]

Pass 1:

Compared 9 and 3. Swapped them, as 3 is smaller. Result: [3, 9, 5, 2, 6, 1]
Compared 9 and 5. Swapped them, as 5 is smaller. Result: [3, 5, 9, 2, 6, 1]
Compared 9 and 2. Swapped them, as 2 is smaller. Result: [3, 5, 2, 9, 6, 1]
Compared 9 and 6. Swapped them, as 6 is smaller. Result: [3, 5, 2, 6, 9, 1]
Compared 9 and 1. Swapped them, as 1 is smaller. Result: [3, 5, 2, 6, 1, 9]
Pass 2:

Compared 3 and 5. No swap needed. Result: [3, 5, 2, 6, 1, 9]
Compared 5 and 2. Swapped them, as 2 is smaller. Result: [3, 2, 5, 6, 1, 9]
Compared 5 and 6. No swap needed. Result: [3, 2, 5, 6, 1, 9]
Compared 6 and 1. Swapped them, as 1 is smaller. Result: [3, 2, 5, 1, 6, 9]
Pass 3:

Compared 3 and 2. Swapped them, as 2 is smaller. Result: [2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 9]
Compared 3 and 5. No swap needed. Result: [2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 9]
Compared 5 and 1. Swapped them, as 1 is smaller. Result: [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 9]
Pass 4:

Compared 2 and 3. No swap needed. Result: [2, 3, 1, 5, 6, 9]
Compared 3 and 1. Swapped them, as 1 is smaller. Result: [2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 9]
Pass 5:

Compared 2 and 1. Swapped them, as 1 is smaller. Result: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9]
